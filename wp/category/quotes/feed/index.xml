<h1>32 Mark Cuban Quotes</h1>
<p><strong>1.</strong> “Don’t start a company unless it’s an obsession and something you love. If you have an exit strategy, it’s not an obsession.” –<strong>Mark Cuban</strong></p>
<p><strong>2.</strong> “I love to compete. To me, business is the ultimate sport. It’s always on. There is always someone trying to beat me.” –<strong>Mark Cuban</strong></p>
<p><strong>3.</strong> “Creating opportunities means looking where others are not.” –<strong>Mark Cuban</strong></p>
<p><strong>4.</strong> “Wherever I see people doing something the way it’s always been done, the way it’s ‘supposed’ to be done, following the same old trends, well, that’s just a big red flag to me to go look somewhere else.” –<strong>Mark Cuban</strong></p>
<p><strong>5.</strong> “Small businesses don’t fail for lack of capital. They fail for lack of brains, they fail for lack of effort.” <strong>–</strong><strong>Mark Cuban</strong></p>
<p><strong>6.</strong> “The key is having great players. But there are a lot of teams that have All-Stars and haven’t been able to put it together.” –<strong>Mark Cuban</strong></p>
<h2><a href="http://amzn.to/2hM87ON">“If you’re going to compete with me or one of my businesses, you’d better recognize that I’m working 24 hours a day to kick your ass.”</a> –<strong>Mark Cuban</strong></h2>
<p><strong>8.</strong> “Doesn’t matter if the glass is half-empty or half-full. All that matters is that you are the one pouring the water.” –<strong>Mark Cuban</strong></p>
<p><strong>9.</strong> “What I’ve learned is that if you really want to be successful at something, you’ll find that you put the time in. You won’t just ask somebody if it’s a good idea, you’ll go figure out if it’s a good idea.” –<strong>Mark Cuban</strong></p>
<p><strong>10.</strong> “Social media is just a platform. Twitter is a very simple and immediate broadcast platform.

<p><strong>11.</strong> “Make sure you are the boss. I don’t think I would encourage executives that work for me to blog. There can be only 1 public vision for an organization.” –<strong>Mark Cuban</strong></p>

<p><strong>16.</strong> “What I’ve learned in these 11 years is you just got to stay focused and believe in yourself and trust your own ability and judgment.” –<strong>Mark Cuban</strong></p>
<p><strong>17.</strong> “Money is a scoreboard where you can rank how you’re doing against other people.” –<strong>Mark Cuban</strong></p>
<h2><a href="http://amzn.to/2hM87ON">&#8220;Once you have found out what you love to do, there is only one goal: to be the best in the world at it.”</a> – <strong>Mark Cuban</strong></h2>
<p><strong>19.</strong> “Work like somebody is trying to take it all away from you.” –<strong>Mark Cuban</strong></p>
<p><strong>20.</strong> “For every one of my businesses, what would I have to do to kick my own ass? What ever business you have, there is always someone trying to put you out of business. It’s better for you to figure how they’re going to do it, than they do it.” –<strong>Mark Cuban</strong></p>
<p><strong>21.</strong> “There are always going to be things we love to do. That we dream about doing. That we really, really want to do with our lives. Those passions aren’t worth a nickel.” –<strong>Mark Cuban</strong></p>

<p><strong>28.</strong> “I worked hard and smarter than most people in the businesses I have been in. It’s not in the dreaming, it’s in the doing.” –<strong>Mark Cuban</strong></p>
<p><strong>29.</strong> “I’m a believer that you accomplish much, much more with direct relationships than by using an intermediary. And that cash you keep in the bank can be the difference between staying alive as a small business, or not.” –<strong>Mark Cuban</strong></p>
<p><strong>30.</strong> “It’s not about money or connections — it’s the willingness to outwork and out-learn everyone… And if it fails, you learn from what happened and do a better job next time. We are acting in the best interests of shareholders.” –<strong>Mark Cuban</strong></p>
